 Stealth/Action/Adventure game made in UnrealEngine 5.4

Player mechanics:
Player can move around in 3D space, jump and crouch. Player can also walljump, wallslide (vertically, when going down) and grab ledges.
Main premise of this game is navigating through areas filled with enemies and obstacles using dynamic stealth mechanic. Depending on your movement stance (standing, crouching, walking, sprinting, jumping) your chances of
getting spotted change (I may introduce more stuff here, maybe some sound system).
To play around with enemies Player can either try to fight and kill enemies straight on, or using deadly backstabs. If Player however wants to be stealthy he can use hiding spots, toss stones to distract enemies and maneuver
around them.
If Player gets too close enemies will begind chasing. There is also "investigation" mode in AI - if Player is slightly out of Enemy vision range they become suspicious and investigate area.
